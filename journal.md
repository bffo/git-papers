Introduction

The purpose of this Open Science Best Practices portfolio is to facilitate the discovery, selection, and appropriate use of standards and best practices that support Open Science and FAIR data at the Neuro. Here we wish to provide easy-to-follow guides to help you accomplish routine administrative and meta-research tasks. 

The relevance and usefulness of Open Science at the Neuro are manifold, and they do also mean that there may be many things for you to be concurrent. Although we want to encourage you to do it all, we also appreciate that it may be easier to take it one step at a time. Open Science means that you are transparent and that you maximize accessibility and reproducibility. This makes for better Science. Science, in the academic setting, also needs to be Open so that all humanity can benefit from the output of the work we do, funded by public funds, or charitable foundations, all of whom want their spent resources to have the longest and best impact for all. Science also needs to be reproducible, and for that, it needs to be Open.

There are a number of these documents for many fields of science created worldwide for Open Science, and our task here is to assemble what scientists at the Neuro and like-minded institutes will likely need to engage and deliver using the best Open Science practices.
